In this job, we are downloading Excel sheets from a shared drive. The first Excel sheet is a chart of accounts, and this ties all the various identifiers together to add information to the budget, such as department name, asset description, and account description, among others. Otherwise, the actual budget datasets would be sparse, including just a few columns of identifers and a dollar amount. After we process the chart of accounts, and create four corresponding reference datasets, we create the actual budget datasets, including the operating budget, and two different CIP budgets. One of the CIP budgets is not updated at the same frequency as the other two datasets, so we spend a lot of lines of code checking if files exist.
